# GoBank API

The GoBank API is a lightweight and efficient JSON API server implemented in Go. It provides endpoints for managing bank accounts and performing account-related operations. With easy-to-use RESTful endpoints, developers can quickly integrate banking functionalities into their applications.

## Features

- Handle GET requests to retrieve account information.
- Handle POST requests to create new accounts.
- Handle DELETE requests to delete existing accounts.
- Handle error responses gracefully.

```

### 3. Build the project:
